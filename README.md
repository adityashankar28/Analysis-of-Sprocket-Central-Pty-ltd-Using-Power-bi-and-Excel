## About the Dataset:-
It contain 4 datasets 
Customer Demographic,Customer Addresses,Transaction data in the past three months,New customer list.

## Objective-
The Dashboard is created as part of Forage - KPMG Sprocket Central analysis task. The dataset is first cleaned then transformed and visualized using Excel & Microsoft Power BI. The requirements of the tasks are as follows:-
* What are the trends in the underlying data?
* Which customer segment has the highest customer value?
* What do you propose should be Sprocket Central Pty Ltd â€™s marketing and growth strategy?

## Analysis-
* In the previous data, the age group of 40-49 was observed as the top purchasing group for two-wheelers, followed by the age group of 30-39. However, in the new data, the second most prominent purchasing age group is now 50-59.
* The most profitable brand is "WeareA2B" with a profit of 2.12 million, followed by "Solex" with 1.88 million and "Trek Bicycles" with 1.45 million. These brands predominantly generate higher sales in their standard product lines, particularly within the medium product class category.
* On the other hand, the consumers show less interest in the mountain and touring product lines, resulting in lower sales for those particular product categories.
* Approximately 50 percent of the profit is derived from the mass segment, indicating its significant contribution to overall profitability.
* The majority of customers primarily belong to the manufacturing, financial, and health industries.
* The states of NSW and VIC hold potential market opportunities for the company. However, NSW exhibits greater potential as a significant number of people in that 
  state do not own a car, suggesting an opportunity to target value customers.
  
## Recommendation-
Based on the analysis, the potential customers among the new customer list are individuals aged between 40 and 49 who belong to the mass segments. Additionally, these customers reside in the states of NSW and VIC, and work in the manufacturing, financial, and health sectors.
Additionally, there are those clients who belong to the wealthy and high net worth person who who contribute far more to the sales than the majority of mass customers. To keep such valuable, consumers a company must also identify them and offer them a personalized service.
In order to increase the share of current customers sales as well as new customers sales, the companies top 3 brand is WeareA2B,Solex and Giant bicycles are preferred by the majority of their current customers. Therefore, sprocket central should adopt a differentiated market growth strategy by introducing new product lines under these successfully brand umbrellas with some differentiation in features and pricing which will give them an advantage over rivals.
In order to increase profit, the sprocket can cross-sell or upsell to their current clients. In addition ,less profitable product lines such as mountain and touring bicycles should be discontinued as soon as possible. This will help the sprocket to continue growing in long run. Thus they can grow brand users and defend their market share through this.
Therefore all the marketing strategies should be designed in such a way that it will be targeted to these customers only as conversion rate is high with high ROI for such prospects.
